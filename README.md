### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Morgan, I'm a graduating BSc Computer Games Technology Student. 
I specialised in Unreal Engine, C++ and DirectX12 throughout my time at university. I run a small freelance programming company
from my student bedroom.

I developed a Graphic Engine called Creative Engine using DirectX12 and C++17.
I also have certifications in AWS and Microsoft Azure.
