### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Morgan, I'm a graduating BSc Computer Games Technology Student. 
I specialised in Unreal Engine, C++ and DirectX12 throughout my time at university, while also digging into tools development inside Autodesk Maya and 3D Studio Max.

I've also worked on several indie style games in unity, though my main area of interest is anything AAA. I run a small freelance programming company from my student bedroom working with Unreal Engine.

I developed a Graphic Engine called Creative Engine using DirectX12, HLSL Shader Model 6.2 and C++17, it was developed using Azure DevOps with bespoke CI/CD pipelines.

I also have certifications in AWS and Microsoft Azure, and I'm learning Rust in my free time.



Anything geeky and technical is my bag, I'm looking for full time software development opportunties, and I'm passionate about working with C++, DevOps and anything super complicated I can get myself stuck into, as well as Unreal Engine.
