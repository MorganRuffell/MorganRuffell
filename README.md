### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Morgan, I'm a graduating BSc Computer Games Technology Student. 
I specialised in Unreal Engine, C++ and DirectX12 throughout my time at university, I've also worked on several indie style games in unity, though my main area of interest is anything AAA. I run a small freelance programming company from my student bedroom working with Unreal Engine.

I developed a Graphic Engine called Creative Engine using DirectX12, HLSL Shader Model 6.2 and C++17.

I also have certifications in AWS and Microsoft Azure.

Anything geeky and technical is my bag, I'm looking for full time software development opportunties, and I'm passionate about working with C++ and anything super complicated I can get myself stuck into, as well as Unreal Engine.
